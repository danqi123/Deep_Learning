    "The gradient is a vector that tells us in what direction the weights need to go. More precisely, it tells us how to change the weights to make the loss change fastest. We call our process gradient descent because it uses the gradient to descend the loss curve towards a minimum. Stochastic means \"determined by chance.\" Our training is stochastic because the minibatches are random samples from the dataset. And that's why it's called SGD!"

    "## Introduction\n",
    "In the first two lessons, we learned how to build fully-connected networks out of stacks of dense layers. When first created, all of the network's weights are set randomly -- the network doesn't \"know\" anything yet. In this lesson we're going to see how to train a neural network; we're going to see how neural networks learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with all machine learning tasks, we begin with a set of training data. Each example in the training data consists of some features (the inputs) together with an expected target (the output). Training the network means adjusting its weights in such a way that it can transform the features into the target. In the 80 Cereals dataset, for instance, we want a network that can take each cereal's 'sugar', 'fiber', and 'protein' content and produce a prediction for that cereal's 'calories'. If we can successfully train a network to do that, its weights must represent in some way the relationship between those features and that target as expressed in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the training data, we need two more things:\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"loss function\" that measures how good the network's predictions are.\n",
    "An \"optimizer\" that can tell the network how to change its weights."

    "## The Optimizer - Stochastic Gradient Descent\n",

    "The animation shows the linear model from Lesson 1 being trained with SGD. The pale red dots depict the entire training set, while the solid red dots are the minibatches. Every time SGD sees a new minibatch, it will shift the weights (w the slope and b the y-intercept) toward their correct values on that batch. Batch after batch, the line eventually converges to its best fit. You can see that the loss gets smaller as the weights get closer to their true values.\n",

    "## Learning Rate and Batch Size\n",
    "Notice that the line only makes a small shift in the direction of each batch (instead of moving all the way). The size of these shifts is determined by the learning rate. A smaller learning rate means the network needs to see more minibatches before its weights converge to their best values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning rate and the size of the minibatches are the two parameters that have the largest effect on how the SGD training proceeds. Their interaction is often subtle and the right choice for these parameters isn't always obvious. (We'll explore these effects in the exercise.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, for most work it won't be necessary to do an extensive hyperparameter search to get satisfactory results. Adam is an SGD algorithm that has an adaptive learning rate that makes it suitable for most problems without any parameter tuning (it is \"self tuning\", in a sense). Adam is a great general-purpose optimizer."
